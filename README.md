In this assignment let's build a **Authentication Functionality** App by
applying the concepts we have learned till now.

### Refer to image below:

#### Add Functionality

The app must have the following functionalities

- When an unauthenticated user tries to access the `HomeRoute` or `AboutRoute`
  then the page should be redirected to the `LoginRoute`.
- When an authenticated user tries to access the `HomeRoute`, or `AboutRoute`
  then the page should be navigated to the respective route.
- When an authenticated user tries to access the `LoginRoute` then the page
  should be redirected to `HomeRoute`
- When the Logout button is clicked then the page should be navigated to the
  `LoginRoute`.
- When an undefined path is provided in the URL then the page should be
navigated to the `NotFoundRoute`

- Success response from the URL `https://apis.ccbp.in/login` will be

```json
{
  "jwt_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InJhaHVsIiwicm9sZSI6IlBSSU1FX1VTRVIiLCJpYXQiOjE2MTk2Mjg2MTN9.nZDlFsnSWArLKKeF0QbmdVfLgzUbx1BGJsqa2kc_21Y"
}
```

> #### Important Note

> <details open>
> <summary>Click to view Important Note Points</summary>
>
> - `HomeRoute` should consist of "/" in URL path
> - `LoginRoute` should consist of "/login" in URL path
> - `AboutRoute` should consist of "/about" in URL path
> - No need to use the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` as we have already included
>   in `index.js`
> - As this assignment is mainly designed for Authentication Functionality and
>   does not contain any input fields, use the below sample credentials to login
>
>   - Sample credentials
>
>     ```
>      username: rahul
>      password: rahul@2021
>     ```

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being
>   imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a
>   look at the Cheat Sheets.
